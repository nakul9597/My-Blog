<h2>Recursive tree view for gem dependencies</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
This project would add a feature on the rubygems.org website to give an option on each gem web page to show a tree/DAG of all transitive dependencies needed by that gem. In one of the [`issue`][issue] that lead to this project, a user talks about how some users download a gem based of itâ€™s transitive dependencies and how they need to keep a mindmap of these transitive dependencies to conclude whether or not to use the gem. This project will help such users get a better idea of whether that gem is for them or not.

<h3>Road Map</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Front end**
* List of dependencies for that particular gem
* Arrow before each dependency which when clicked will display all of that gem's dependencies
* This keeps happening for all dependencies on the page. Once a dependency is clicked, it can't be clicked again (only toggled for hiding its dependencies).
* All dependencies are divided by runtime or development scope
* Both dependencies and scopes are togglable

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Back end**
* Write a controller to use gem name and version to find its dependencies
* Use rubygem code to find best version for each dependency based on it's requirement
* Controller should render html and json (for ajax clicks)
* write functional and integration tests

<h3>The Story So Far</h3>
* First created a web page that displays all the transitive dependencies list in ascending order
  * It was taking too long to load and not very user friendly
* Created basic webpage with toggling
* Added ajax request to find transitive dependencies but creating a js file in view
* Made toggling possible to open and close dependencies
* Moved the js file to asset pipeline thus making ajax requests client side
* Added functional test case for controller and integration test for js
* Seperated view as runtime and development dependencies, also togglable to be hidden

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
I'd like to thank my mentors Aditya Prakash and Qui Chaofan for always monitoring my progress, immediately responding and guiding me whenever I needed help. I know I asked a lot of doubts and they helped me every time. I also know I must have been a little difficult to work with, so thank you for having the patience. I owe my wholehearted thanks and appreciation to the entire team of ruby and rubygem.org for selecting me for this project and for their assistance during the entire project work.
